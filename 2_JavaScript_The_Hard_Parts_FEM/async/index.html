    <h1>Asynchronicity</h1>
    <p>
      These challenges will build your understanding of asynchronous events,
      such as timers, event listeners, and AJAX calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will need to remove comments at the beginning of each challenge to
      work on them, and then comment them out again before moving on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Create a clone of this challenge (File>Clone)
      to keep track of your changes. Create a JSBin account to come back to it
      later - or write down the new URL.
    </p>
    <section id="challenge1">
      <h3>Challenge 1</h3>
      <p>
        Write code that will log to the console, 'I am at the beginning of the
        code'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beneath that console log, set a timer (see setTimeout) that will log to
        the console 'I am in the setTimeout callback function' after 3 seconds
        (3000 ms)
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, add code to the end of the challenge to log 'I am at the end of
        the code'. Now re-run the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure the 'console' and 'output' panes are showing (click the tabs
        above if not) and then run your code with the 'Run with JS' button.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clear the console. Change the delay time in the time from 3000 ms to 0.
        Think hard about how the order should change and then run the code
        again.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="challenge2">
      <h3>Challenge 2</h3>
      <p>
        Write code that will log to the console "Interval Hello!" every 2
        seconds (see setInterval). Use the given
        <code>clearAllIntervals</code> function to clear all the messages when
        you have this functionality working.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, modify your code so that the "Interval Hello!" messages will
        automatically stop after 10 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, modify your code again so that the "Interval Hello!" messages will
        automatically stop after 10 seconds without use of the
        <code>clearAllIntervals</code> function, and using
        <code>clearInterval</code> only once. Perform research if you are unsure
        how to do this.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="challenge3">
      <h3>Challenge 3</h3>
      <p>
        Write a function <code>everyXsecsForYsecs</code> that will accept three
        arguments: a function, an interval time in seconds, and a total time in
        seconds. <code>everyXsecsForYsecs</code> should invoke the given
        function every X times 1000 milliseconds, but then stop invoking the
        function after Y times 1000 milliseconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Write function <code>sayHowdy</code> that will log "Howdy" to the
        console. Then test your <code>everyXsecsForYsecs</code> function by
        using it to invoke <code>sayHowdy</code> every 1 second for 5 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, modify your <code>everyXsecsForYsecs</code> function so it does not
        use setInterval, but still keeps the same functionality.
      </p>

      <h3>Challenge 4</h3>
      <p>
        Recreate the built in array method, <code>forEach</code>: Write a
        function that takes as parameters an array, <code>arr</code>, and a
        callback function, <code>cb</code>. The <code>forEach</code> function
        will iterate through <code>arr</code> passing each element and its index
        as arguments to <code>cb</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a variable named <code>delays</code> and assign to it an array
        with the numbers 2000, 5000, 0, and 3500 (in that order).
      </p>
      <p>
        Write a function, <code>delayLog</code>, that takes as input a
        <code>delayTime</code> and an index, <code>i</code>. When invoked, the
        function should wait <code>delayTime</code> milliseconds before logging
        to the console, "printing element i" (with "i" replaced with the actual
        index passed in).
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting it all together, run the <code>delayLog</code> function on each
        item of the <code>delays</code> array using the
        <code>forEach</code> function you created.
      </p>

    <section id="challenge5">
      <h3>Challenge 5</h3>
      <button id="activate">#1: Activate Other Button</button>
      <button id="color">#2: Change BG Color</button>
      <p>
        Write a function <code>changeColor</code> that when invoked will first
        check if the current page background color is "rgb(221, 238, 255)". If
        it is, it changes the color to "rgb(255, 238, 221)". If it isn't, it
        sets the color to "rgb(221, 238, 255)".
      </p>
      <p>
        Add a click event listener to button #1 above (it has an id of
        "activate"). On click, the button should log to the console "clicked
        #1". It should also set up a click event listener on button #2 (id of
        "color"). That listener should log to console "clicked #2" and then call
        the <code>changeColor</code> function you just created.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clear the console and hit the 'Run with JS' button. Look at what code
        has run by analyzing the console. Then try to change the background
        color by clicking button #2. What needs to happen for the button to
        work?
      </p>

    <section id="challenge6">
      <h3>Challenge 6</h3>
      <p>
        In this challenge we are going to simulate an AJAX call to get
        information from a server. This is not a real AJAX call, but the
        asynchonicity is similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modify the function <code>ajaxSimulate</code> to take an
        <code>id</code> and a <code>callback</code> function as input. After the
        <code>database</code> array, set a timer that will pass the element of
        <code>database</code> whose index matches <code>id</code> to the
        <code>callback</code> function after 0 ms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a second function <code>storeData</code> (outside of
        ajaxSimulate) that takes <code>data</code> as input and assigns it to
        the <code>dataReceived</code> variable already defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Invoke the <code>ajaxSimulate</code> function with an <code>id</code> of
        1 and the <code>storeData</code> function as the <code>callback</code>.
        Immediately after, log to the console the value of
        <code>dataReceived</code>. What do you expect it to be?
      </p>
      <p>
        Without changing anything else, copy-paste the
        <code>console.log</code> statement somewhere where it will log with the
        info we need.
